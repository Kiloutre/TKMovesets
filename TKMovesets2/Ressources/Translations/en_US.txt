# Extraction #
extraction.explanation = Movesets have to first be extracted from the game to be then used. Extracts only movesets : not models or visual effects.\nExtraction is done with the game running (from memory), with the target character(s) loaded and visible on the screen (it doesn't matter what gamemode).
extraction.extraction = Extraction
extraction.extract = Extract
extraction.extract_both = Extract (1P & 2P)
extraction.extract_from = Extract from:
extraction.overwrite_duplicate = Overwrite moveset with same name
extraction.overwrite_explanation = Enable to overwrite moveset with same names.\nDisable to have name conflicts resolved with number suffixes.\nEx: T7_JIN (2)
extraction.progress = Extracting... (%.0f%%)
extraction.extracted_movesets = Extracted movesets
extraction.rename = Rename moveset
extraction.cant_extract = Cannot extract because characters aren't loaded.

# Importation #
importation.explanation = After movesets are extracted and saved on your computer, they can be loaded into an active game (must not be online) using this submenu. This is a one time only thing: movesets loaded here will be unloaded after you pass through any loading screen, so this is mainly for training mode use.\nFor online play, see the "Online" section.
importation.importation = Importation
importation.select_moveset = Select moveset to import
importation.deallocate_unused = Deallocate unused movesets
importation.cant_import = Cannot import because you are not loaded into an active game (training mode, etc).
importation.import_to = Import to:
importation.progress = Importing... (%.0f%%)
importation.apply_instantly = Apply instantly
importation.apply_instantly_explanation = Turning this to off will let the game wait until the current move ends before switching to the new moveset.\nIn the cases of some moves (like Negan's idle animation), this can take pretty long.
importation.free_unused_movesets = Free unused movesets
importation.free_unused_movesets_explanation = If turned on, movesets that were previously allocated but are now unused will be freed from memory.\nThis helps prevent this tool from using all your RAM.

# Online #
online.explanation = Online play requires both players to have this tool running.\nYou must each select your moveset before the match's loading screen, the tool will in the background synchronize moveset files without you having to send it to one another.\nCustom movesets will not be loaded if you or the opponent do not have the tool running with a valid moveset selected.
online.select_moveset = Select moveset
online.no_selected_moveset = No moveset selected

# Moveset Edition #
edition.explanation = You can here edit extracted movesets. Refer to documentation for tutorials and helpful ressources.\nTurn on 'Live edition' for quickly modifying the custom moveset: Simple values changes will be instantly applied in memory with zero loading time.
edition.suggest_new_name = This moveset appears to be a freshly extracted one. Do you want to give the modified copy a new name?
edition.no_custom_loaded = Load a custom moveset in memory to be able turn on live edition
edition.non_trivial_detected = A non-trivial change was detected and requires re-importation to be applied.
edition.target_player = Target player:
edition.warning_target_change = Changing selected player while live edition is on will turn off live edition for the old player. Continue?
edition.custom_loaded = Custom moveset loaded
edition.enable_live = Enable live edition
edition.disable_live = Disable live edition
edition.save = Save
