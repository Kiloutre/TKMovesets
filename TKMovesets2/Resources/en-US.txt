## Submenus ##

# Extraction #
extraction.explanation = Movesets have to first be extracted from the game to be then used. Extracts only movesets : not models or visual effects.\nExtraction is done with the game running (from memory), with the target character(s) loaded and visible on the screen (it doesn't matter what gamemode).
extraction.extraction = Extraction
extraction.extract = Extract
extraction.extract_all = Extract (all)
extraction.extract_from = Extract from:
extraction.overwrite_duplicate = Overwrite moveset with same name
extraction.overwrite_explanation = Enable to overwrite moveset with same names.\nDisable to have name conflicts resolved with number suffixes.\nEx: T7_JIN (2)
extraction.progress = Extracting... (%u%%)
extraction.progress_error = Extracting error (%u%%)
extraction.progress_done = Extracting... Done!
extraction.extracted_movesets = Extracted movesets
extraction.cant_extract = Cannot extract because characters aren't loaded.
extraction.error_file_creation = There was an error while creating the moveset file
extraction.error_compression = There was an error while compressing the moveset file
extraction.error_allocation = There was a memory allocation error while copying the moveset data
extraction.mota_explanation = Additional animations
extraction.settings = Settings
extraction.settings.other = Other
extraction.settings.displayable_movelist = Displayable movelist
extraction.settings.compress_moveset = Compress moveset

# Importation #
importation.explanation = After movesets are extracted and saved on your computer, they can be loaded into an active game (must not be online) using this submenu. This is a one time only thing: movesets loaded here will be unloaded after you pass through any loading screen, so this is mainly for training mode use.\nFor online play, see the "Online" section.
importation.importation = Importation
importation.select_moveset = Select moveset to import
importation.cant_import = Cannot import because you are not loaded into an active game (training mode, etc).
importation.import_to = Import to:
importation.progress = Importing... (%u%%)
importation.progress_error = Importing error (%u%%)
importation.progress_done = Importing... Done!
importation.apply_instantly = Apply instantly
importation.apply_instantly_explanation = Turning this to off will let the game wait until the current move ends before switching to the new moveset.\nIn the cases of some moves (like Negan's idle animation), this can take pretty long.
importation.free_unused_movesets = Free unused movesets
importation.free_unused_movesets_explanation = If turned on, movesets that were previously allocated but are now unused will be freed from memory.\nThis helps prevent this tool from using all your RAM.
importation.error_file_reading = There was an error while reading the moveset file
importation.error_allocation = There was a memory allocation error while reading the moveset data
importation.error_game_allocation = There was a game memory allocation error while writing the moveset data
importation.error_decompression = Therewas an error while decompressing the moveset data

# Persistent play #
persistent.explanation = The persistent mode allows you to select the movesets to apply on players, with those movesets staying across loading screens and even if you switch the side you're playing on.\nThis can be used online if the opponent also has this tool running, with each of you having downloaded/extracted both movesets already:\nYou must then each set your own moveset (or None) as "Player 1", and the opponent's moveset (or None) as "Player 2", and lock-in.
persistent.player_1 = Player 1:
persistent.player_2 = Player 2:
persistent.player_3 = Player 3:
persistent.player_4 = Player 4:
persistent.none = No moveset
persistent.lock = Lock characters
persistent.unlock = Unlock
persistent.hash = Hash:
persistent.select_moveset = Select moveset
persistent.clear_moveset = Clear moveset

# Online #
online.explanation = Online play requires both players to have this tool running.\nYou must each select your moveset (or none if you want) before the match's loading screen , the tool will in the background synchronize moveset files without you having to send it to one another.\nCustom movesets will not be loaded if you or the opponent do not have the tool running.
online.select_moveset = Select moveset
online.no_selected_moveset = No moveset selected
online.dll_not_loaded = DLL is not loaded, inject it
online.inject_dll = Inject

# Moveset Edition #
edition.explanation = You can hereedit extracted movesets. Refer to documentation for tutorials and helpful ressources.\nTurn on 'Live edition' for quickly modifying the custom moveset: Simple values changes will be instantly applied in memory with zero loading time.
edition.select_moveset = Chose the moveset to modify
edition.last_saved = Last save:
edition.save = Save
edition.discard_changes = Discard changes?\nIf live edition is enabled, this will not reset the structure back to its original state in-game.
edition.process_err = Error
edition.live_edition = Live edition
edition.live_edition_explanation = Turn on so that trivial changes such as simple value modifications can be applied directory in the game memory, without requing a new moveset importation.\nAdding or removing items from a list, or anything requiring extra moveset size will require a new importation.

# About #

about.explanation = TKMovesets is a software made by independant modders who are not legally affiliated in any way with the games this software interacts with.\nThis software is licensed under the GPLv3: It is free software (as in freedom) that you are free to obtain, modify and redistribute as long as you do not change the license.\nIf you paid for this software, you have been scammed.
about.credits = Credits:
about.kilo_explanation = Main developer behind the moveset extractor, responsible for reverse engineering the vast majority of the data structures, establishing the export/import methodology, and writing this moveset export/import/edition softwares.
about.ali_explanation = Among other things helped reverse engineer moveset structures, helped significantly figuring out IDs for moveset editing, created moveset editing tutorials and brought about many features like camera and hand animations
about.fletch_explanation = Brought moveset edition to great lengths by creating documentation of a significant number of moveset editing properties and creating many tutorials for it
about.koenji_explanation = Got on moveset edition early and helped understand its workflow a ton, also contributed to deciphering many moveset properties
about.sadamitsu_explanation = Helped understand a lot more about animations of various kind, how they were structured and where they were stored
about.dennis_stanistan_explanation = Unknowingly helped through a random discord post that then allowed the first moveset extractor to get started
